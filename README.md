# Tenzies

This version is for single player.  
Quickly look at your roll and decide which number you are going to go for. (For example, if you have more 3’s than any other number, that’s what you want to go for.) Click at your dice with that number, and quickly roll again.  
Keep rolling until all ten of your dice show the same number.
